Prefix Sum 1D:
    - Ex:
        - Finding summary in many lists from position a to b
    - Instead of adding everything together, which will take
      O(N*M) time. We can use prefix list to reduce the time.

To create prefix list:
    - we always set prefix[0] = 0 for easier reading
    - Sigma symbol (flipped 3) means summary of a list
    - k is the amount of terms involved in calculation

Calculation:
    - finding sum from list(a to b)
    - prefix_list[b] - prefix_list[a-1]
