Bit
- a digit either 1 or 0

Byte: formed by 8-bits
- stores 8-bits to represent a set value or data

Binary number:
- 0x00000010    1 byte data --> 2 in decimal

int - 32-bits / 4 bytes
- 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
- the size of the top is 32 digits
- the largest number you can enter will be 2^32 (common case)
- when we count up negative, there are also 2^32 negative numbers
- so the range of int are -2^32 ~ 2^32 - 1; -1 to include 0.
